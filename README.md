###Code
We used Angular and Firebase to display and store data. The search is done with Angular filter. The review bars are from the bar-rating library. We tweaked it to fit our visual identity.

###CSS
We used Cardinal CSS, which is significantly less opinionated than Bootstrap. This meant we could incorporate our own designs and craft our unique visual identity. The site is set in Source Sans Pro, a beautiful typeface perfect for interfaces and text.

###Design
Simple design allows the user to quickly find what they want to do. The search page/home page is inspired by Google. The user can easily find what they want without getting distracted. The cool colors allow the user to stay on the site for a long time without feel uncomfortable. Blue also signifies trust.
